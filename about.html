            Sasha Myshkina is an independent director, writer and film critic based in London. Her directorial debut "Hiking" was produced
             at the Manhattan Film Institute Summer 2021 program into which she was accepted for her screenwriting and filmmaking skills. 
             She has been screenwriting since the age of 13, and now has experience with screenplays of all lengths. Her films are often 
             characterized by their offbeat humour, witty dialogue and neo-noir surrealism. She is also an experienced film critic, and her reviews,
              much like her screenplays, are characterized by their innovative takes and dry humour.
