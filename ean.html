            <i>Everything and Nothing at the Same Time</i> is a short, surrealist found-footage film, created by Sasha Myshkina in the spring of 2021. Inspired by the techniques and methods 
            that she had used in the creation of <i>Untitled</i>, this second, longer, film conveys a lot of similar ideas. However, despite the fact
            that <i>Untitled</i> had been inspired by the idea of a broken-up train of thought and the nature of duality, <i>Everything and Nothing at the Same Time</i>
            feels like a very separate entity - evoking feelings of stress, panic and speed. Organic sound effects of breathing and heartbeats lend an almost ASMR-like quality 
            to the film.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, whilst <i>Untitled</i>, despite containing several deliberately-filmed clips, was still very solidly a found-footage film in the most traditional sense,
            almost all of this film was shot by Myshkina, on her phone, for the specific occassion, with only a few found clips. However, despite this, it does play a lot like <i>Untitled</i> with
            its cross-cutting of seemingly unrelated things, blurring the definition of what a found-footage film truly is. 
        </p>

            The almost-flippant warning at the start of the film - "The film you are about to see has no meaning" - conveys the main message of this film: that what it 
            truly means is up to the viewer.
