            <i>Hiking</i> is a short film created at the Manhattan Film Institute Summer 2021 Director's Gold program. The Manhattan Film Institute 
            is a high successful program that has been running for two weeks every summer for over ten years, wherein aspiring
            filmmakers of all ages are invited to direct their very own short film.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Hiking</i> was both written and directed by 
            Sasha Myshkina. She also edited and served as the stunt coordinator, VFX specialist and poster designer. She was the 
            youngest director at the program that year and overall one of the youngets people ever accepted into the directing program, 
            as well a the first to do an ambitious green screen stunt in the entire history of MFI. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of <i>Hiking</i> arose after Myshkina herself was made to hike up a difficult trail, and soon became a short script inspired
            by the experience, with plenty of trademark off-beat humour.
